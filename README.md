# Web weather single-page-application on Vue

### About
This is test weather application for SimbirSoft. Here I tried to work with https://openweathermap.org/api to get some info about current temperature, wind speed, pressure etc. This SPA has three pages: "home", "default-weather" and "detailed-weather". On the "default-weather" page you can get information about weather in three different cities. On the "detailed-weather" page you can get more information about specific city. Also it has two different themes. 
### Some examples of pages
